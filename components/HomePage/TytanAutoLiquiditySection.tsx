                            Every 12 hours at 22:52:48 UTC time our TYTAN Auto-Liquidity Engine (TALE) will inject
                            automatic liquidity into the market. On each buy or sell order there is a 4% tax fee that
                            automatically gets stored into an Auto-LP wallet and built into our protocolâ€™s smart
                            contract is the mechanism which smartly takes the 50% of the amount of TYTAN stored in the
                            wallet, and will automatically buy BNB at the current market price.

                            The remaining 50% of TYTAN in the Auto-LP wallet will be used for the TYTAN side of
                            liquidity, therefore giving equal an 50/50 weighting of TYTAN/BNB which will then be
                            automatically added as new, additional liquidity into the market pair and raising the amount
                            of liquidity in the pool.

                            The TALE will do this every 12 hours by adding more and more liquidity to the pool which
                            will allow $TYTAN token holders to easily sell their tokens at anytime with little to no
                            market slippage. It will also aid in maintaining protocol stability to make sure the APY is
                            upheld for the entire life of TYTAN.
